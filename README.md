# odin-recipes

This project is a straightforward recipe website built using HTML. The goal of this work is to practice and showcase the fundamental HTML skills I've learned from The Odin Project's HTML Foundations course. These skills include creating paragraphs and text elements, formatting text, and incorporating links and images, among other basic HTML techniques.
