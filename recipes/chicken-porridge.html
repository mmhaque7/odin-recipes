        <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce (Optional)</li>
        <li>
            1 cup glutinous sweet rice </li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, garlic, and ginger in hot oil until fragrant,
            about 5 minutes. Add chicken wings; cook and stir for 1 minute. Stir in fish sauce, cover, and cook another
            2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour chicken broth into the pot. Stir in sweet rice and bring mixture to a boil. Cover and cook for 10
            minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent rice from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Season with salt and
            pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Portion soup into bowls and garnish with green onion. Serve with lemon slices and additional fish sauce, if
            desired.
        </li>
    </ol>
